Nextra should ignore `.canvas` files and the `.obsidian` folder **by default**, as it primarily looks for `.mdx` and `.md` files inside the specified `contentDir`. However, depending on your setup, there are a couple of things to check to ensure that `.canvas` and `.obsidian` files are fully ignored and don’t interfere.

### **How Nextra Handles Non-MDX Files**

- **File Types**: Nextra automatically **ignores** non-markdown and non-MDX files when it generates static paths and content. It only reads `.mdx` and `.md` files.
- **Hidden Folders**: `.obsidian` is a hidden folder, and Nextra does not usually scan hidden folders unless explicitly instructed.
- **Custom Handling**: If for some reason files in `.obsidian/` or `.canvas` files get picked up, you can explicitly **ignore** them in your Next.js configuration.

## **How to Ensure `.obsidian` and `.canvas` Are Ignored**

If you notice any issues, try the following:

### **1. Check That the Content Directory Is Clean**

Ensure your `content` folder is structured in a way that Nextra only looks at the `ai-docs/` and `media-docs/` subdirectories:

```
content/
├── ai-docs/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   ├── some-doc.mdx
│   ├── ...
├── media-docs/
│   ├── index.mdx
│   ├── another-doc.mdx
│   ├── ...
├── .obsidian/  ❌ (should be ignored)
│   ├── workspace.json
│   ├── plugins/
│   └── ...
├── example.canvas  ❌ (should be ignored)
```

**Expected behavior**: Nextra will only scan the `ai-docs/` and `media-docs/` folders, and **not** look inside `.obsidian` or parse `.canvas` files.

---

### **2. Manually Exclude Certain Files in `next.config.js`**

If you find that `.obsidian/` or `.canvas` files are somehow interfering, you can manually ensure Nextra ignores them. Modify `next.config.js`:

```js
const withNextra = require('nextra')({
  theme: 'nextra-theme-docs',
  contentDir: 'content',
  contentDirBasePath: '',
  unstable_flexsearch: true, // Optional: enables search
  transform: async (mdxContent, { filePath }) => {
    // Ignore unwanted files
    if (filePath.includes('.obsidian') || filePath.endsWith('.canvas')) {
      return null; // Skip processing these files
    }
    return mdxContent;
  }
});

module.exports = withNextra({
  reactStrictMode: true
});
```

This **prevents** Nextra from processing any file inside `.obsidian` or any `.canvas` files.

---

### **3. Ensure `.obsidian/` and `.canvas` Files Are Not Tracked by Git**

Even though they shouldn’t interfere, adding them to your `.gitignore` ensures they don’t clutter your repo:

```
# Ignore Obsidian config and metadata
.obsidian/
*.canvas
```

---

### **4. Check the Local Development Behavior**

Run your Next.js app with:

```bash
npm run dev
```

Then check:

- **Sidebar links**: Are `.canvas` or `.obsidian` files showing up in the docs UI?
- **Console output**: Are there any errors related to `.obsidian/` or `.canvas`?
- **Build output** (`npm run build`): Do you see warnings about unrecognized file types?

If everything runs cleanly and your docs pages work normally, then Nextra is handling things properly.

---

### **5. Alternative: Use a Separate Folder for Editing in Obsidian**

If you don’t want to risk any conflicts at all, you could:

- Maintain a **separate folder** for Obsidian that syncs with the `content/` folder used by Nextra.
- Use a script (e.g., `rsync` or a Node.js script) to copy valid `.mdx` files from your Obsidian vault to your Next.js content directory.

---

### **Conclusion**

Yes, **Nextra should ignore** `.obsidian/` and `.canvas` files by default, but:

1. If you encounter issues, use the **`transform` function in `next.config.js`** to ensure those files are skipped.
2. Ensure `.obsidian/` and `.canvas` are **not tracked** in Git.
3. Run the Next.js app and check if anything unexpected appears in the sidebar or console.
4. Consider **keeping a separate folder for editing in Obsidian** if needed.

This setup allows you to **edit MDX files seamlessly in Obsidian while using Nextra for rendering them on your Next.js site**. 🚀
